R_shiny.Rmd generates a shiny app for the history of term use


results:

Democratic would use more the words like: union, democracy, children, women, generation
Republican would use more the words like: bussiness, freedom, laws, economy, laws, labor, amendment

So we can see that Democratic tend to say something more about democracy while Republican like to mention government-related issues like laws, rece, economy
